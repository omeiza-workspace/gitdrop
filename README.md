# gitdrop
The goal of this project is to create a GitHub app that allows users to remotely manage their GitHub repositories with a user-friendly interface, featuring a drag-and-drop file upload capability.


# Project Overview
=====================

### The GitHub Repository Management Application

The GitHub Repository Management Application is an open-source project that provides a user-friendly interface for managing GitHub repositories. The application is built using Angular and Spring Boot, and offers features such as repository listing and filtering, repository creation and deletion, issue tracking and management, pull request management, and user authentication and authorization.

# Technical Requirements
==========================

### Frontend (Angular)
####

* **Angular Version**: 13+
* **Component Architecture**: Angular's component-based architecture is used to create reusable UI components
* **Services**: Angular's services are used to interact with the Spring Boot backend API
* **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and provide a seamless user experience across various devices
* **UI Library**: Angular Material is used to create a visually appealing interface

### Backend (Spring Boot)
####

* **Spring Boot Version**: 2.5+
* **Annotation-Based Configuration**: Spring Boot's annotation-based configuration is used to define API endpoints, database connections, and security
* **Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot's auto-configuration features are used to simplify development and deployment
* **Authentication and Authorization**: OAuth, JWT, or other mechanisms are used to implement authentication and authorization
* **Database**: Spring Data JPA or Hibernate is used to interact with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Database
####

* **Database Management System**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
* **Database Schema**: A database schema is designed to store repository metadata, issues, pull requests, and user information

### Security
####

* **Authentication and Authorization**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure data exchange between the frontend and backend
* **HTTPS**: The HTTPS protocol is used to encrypt data transmission between the client and server
* **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

### Deployment
####

* **Cloud Platform**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure
* **Containerization**: Docker is used to simplify deployment and scaling
* **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitoring and logging mechanisms are implemented to ensure application reliability and performance

### Testing
####

* **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: CI/CD pipelines are implemented to automate testing and deployment

### Documentation
####

* **API Documentation**: Swagger or OpenAPI is used to generate API documentation
* **User Documentation**: User documentation is provided for the application
* **Developer Documentation**: Developer documentation is provided for contributing to the project
* **Documentation Tools**: Javadoc, Doxygen, or Read the Docs are used to generate documentation

### Licensing
